# diabetes
#Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, mlxtend, and missingno.

#Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Missing values are visualized using missingno, and standardization is applied using StandardScaler to improve model performance.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to understand the distribution of features and class balance. Techniques such as scatter matrix plots and correlation heatmaps are used to analyze feature relationships. The outcome distribution is visualized to check for imbalances in the dataset.

#Model Selection

Various machine learning models are tested, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest. Hyperparameter tuning is conducted using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

#Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. ROC curves are plotted to assess the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

#Results

The model achieves a reasonable accuracy in predicting diabetes. Further improvements can be made using hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and advanced ML techniques.

#Conclusion

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict diabetes using patient data. Future work includes:

Deploying the model using Flask or FastAPI.
